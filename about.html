							</span>Growing up in Hong Kong, a multicultured society, I was lucky enough to be bombarded with video games from all around the globe since childhood. I love how western games always manage to bring me on epic grand adventures, while Japanese games often impress me with attention to detail and replayability. Different games possess different styles, yet they are equally addicting. As a kid, every time I complete a game I look at the credits and wonder: how the heck did they do it?
							<br>
							It was therefore no surprise that I dreamt of becoming a game developer ever since. I never stray far from this goal, from striving for my best in public exams, entering university, and majoring in Computer Science, to sharpening my skillset via Mphil research and developing applications with Unity and Unreal Engine at the workplace.
							</p>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>I have 5 years of experience in game development, worked on over 5 commercial VR applications and created 3 games, either individually or with friends.</li>
								<li>Utilizing my knowledge in game development, I also educated over 100 undergraduate students on how to create Unity VR applications. As a game dev lover myself, I honestly really enjoy tutoring students, because I can spread the love of making games, and potentially inspire the next generation of game developers.</li>
								<li>I guided 4 interns to develop their own VR game as a mentor.</li>
								<li>My experiences enable me to contribute both as a team member and independently.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<p>Moving forward, I will continue to go all out to develop great games for my company, while broadening my horizon by exploring different parts of the world. Soon, I will start a new stage in Toronto, which I am very excited about as it is my first time leaving my home country for work. Nevertheless, I will never stop improving myself as a game developer, no matter where I am.
