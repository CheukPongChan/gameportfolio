								<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
								<hr />
								<h2>Research Assistant II</h2>
								<h3>The Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong</h3>

								<h3><i>2021 - 2022</i></h3>

								<br>
								<p>The VR research team in the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing System Engineering has been developing its immersive CAVE system for more than 15 years. Coupled with its in-house made VR Unity plugin - VotanicXR, and its brand new Content Creator tool, they effectively provide and deploy VR solutions to different organisations in the community for them to excel in their business and profession. User cases include a lifting operation simulation for the HK Construction Industry Council, and a ramp operation training simulation for Cathy Pacific Services Limited.</p>

								<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Assisted</b> in developing an optical cargo scanning system</li>

									<li><b>Developed</b> real-time VR visualization tool for robotics teleoperation</li>

									<li><b>Participated</b> in multiple VR applications development</li>

									<li><b>Educated</b> over 100 students on how to develop VR applications via Unity through university courses and workshops, for over 3 years</li>

									<li><b>Mentored</b> multiple interns through the process of VR game development, from game design to final product</li>

									<li>Frequently <b>hosted</b> demo sessions alongside colleagues to promote VR hardware and software developed in-house</li>

								</ul>

								<p>During my career in the University, I had the chance to work with <b>departments from different disciplines</b>, such as the Department of Archaeology, the Robotics experts in the University of Glasgow, and even Government Organisations like the HK DSD. They gave me a chance to contribute by <b>creating Unity VR applications to facilitate teaching and research</b>.<br>Mentoring students helped strengthen my fundamentals knowledge in Unity and boosted my <b>problem solving capabilities</b>, as I was constantly solving students' problems occuring from <b>various development contexts</b>.</p>

								<h2>Student Research Assistant</h2>
								<h3>The Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong</h3>

								<h3><i>Jan 2019 - Sep 2019</i></h3>

								<br>
								<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Developed</b> commercial Unity VR application</li>

									<li><b>Assisted</b> in enabling VR capability for non-VR games</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Software Engineer Intern</h2>
								<h3>Thriveful</h3>

								<h3><i>May 2017 - Aug 2017</i></h3>

								<br>
								<p>Thriveful strives to build innovative services and products based on evidence-based tools to promote the social, cognitive, and emotional well-being of families.</p>

								<h2>Education</h2>
								<hr />
								<h2>Master of Philosophy - Mphil</h2>
								<h3>The University of Hong Kong</h3>

								<h3><i>2019 - 2022</i></h3>

								<br>
								<h4>Research Topic:<br>Reconstructing 3D Indoor Scene from RGB Equirectangular Panorama Images with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) System</h4>

								<p>My research focuses on two of the most popular technologies in the world - VR and Computer Vision. Through the 2 years of work, I have successfully created a Deep neural network-based 3D reconstruction system, which takes 360 indoor RGB equirectangular panorama images as input, and outputs the generated 3D scene.

								<br><br>

								The Mphil studies had truly transformed me into an independent developer, as I had to constantly plan ahead and prioritize pending tasks, and micro-manage them to make sure the deadlines were fulfilled. Furthermore, I had to frequently refine my approach carefully to verify that it is absolutely feasible, or literally every second of effort in the past two years would be in vain.<br><br>
								The experience enabled me to work under immense pressure, and to adapt to varied development circumstances.
