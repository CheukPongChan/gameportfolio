							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Selfie_400.png" alt="" />
							</span>Growing up in Hong Kong, a multicultured society, I was lucky enough to be <b>bombarded with video games</b> from all around the globe since childhood. I love how <b>Western games</b> always manage to bring me on <b>epic grand adventures</b>, while <b>Japanese games</b> often impress me with <b>attention to detail and replayability</b>. Different games possess different styles, yet they are equally addicting. As a kid, every time I complete a game I look at the credits and wonder: how the heck did they do it?
							<br><br>
							It was therefore no surprise that I dreamt of becoming a <b>Game Developer</b> ever since. I <b>never stray far</b> from this goal, from <b>striving for my best</b> in public exams, entering university, and majoring in <b>Computer Science</b>, to sharpening my skillset via <b>Mphil research</b> and developing applications with <b>Unity and Unreal Engine</b> at the workplace.
							</p>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>I have <b>5 years</b> of experience in game development, worked on over <b>5 commercial VR applications</b> and created <b>3</b> games, either individually or with friends.</li>
								<li>Utilizing my knowledge in game development, I also <b>educated over 100 undergraduate students</b> on how to create Unity VR applications. As a game dev lover myself, I honestly really enjoy tutoring students, because I can spread the love of making games, and potentially <b>inspire the next generation</b> of game developers.</li>
								<li>I guided 4 interns to develop their own VR game as a <b>mentor</b>.</li>
								<li>My experiences enable me to contribute both as a <b>team member</b> and <b>independently</b>.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<p>Moving forward, I will continue to <b>go all out</b> to develop great games for my company, while broadening my horizon by exploring different parts of the world. <b>I will never stop improving myself as a game developer, no matter where I am.</b>
